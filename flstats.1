.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Flstats
examines a binary
file created by
.Xr tcpdump  1
(using tcpdump's
.Fl w
option),
and reports statistics on "flows" (for various definitions
of flows) contained in the file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Fl c
Report statistics of flow "classes" (aggregates of flows), rather than
about individual flows themselves.  The difference might be that
different individual flows have different source and destination IP
addresses, whereas the class for all these flows is the class of flows
which looks at (only) source and destination IP addresses.  (This
would be the case if
.Fl -flowtypes Ar dst/src
were specified on the command line -- there would be one class that
held its own statistics for all packets with source and destination
[IP] addresses in them.)

Usage note: only *one* of
.Fl c ,
.Fl f ,
and
.Fl i
can be specified in any given run.
.It Fl d
Run in a mode for debugging flstats itself (normally not interesting
for users of
.Nm flstats
).
.It Fl f
Report statistics about individual flows, rather than "classes".  See
usage note under
.Fl c .
.It Fl i
Run in "interactive" mode, in which the user is prompted for Tcl
commands to execute.  See usage note under
.Fl c .
.It Fl s
Set the process to react to USR1 signals.  After the reception of a USR1
signal the current reporting interval will be terminated and a report
for that interval printed out.  The process will then resume counting
in a new reporting interval.
.It Fl H
Print out a header with the names of the fields that will be printed
in each "column".
.It Fl I
Print reporting interval statistics on a line by themselves before
printing out the class or flow statistics (selected by the
.FL c
or
.FL f
flags).  The class or flow statistics will be prefixed by some number
of blank spaces.
.It Fl L
Causes
.Nm flstats
to print out lines containing information about the input file and the
environment of the execution (for repeatability).  these lines are
prefixed with a '#' (hash mark).
.Fl H
flag) that describe the environment in which the trace is being run.
(This is done to help with repeatability.)
.It Fl T
When printing summary statistics (at the end of a reporting interval),
print the field name before printing the value.
.It Fl -binsecs Ar num
How many seconds (in the time sequence of the input file) should each
reporting interval last.  The default is zero (0), which causes the
statistics to be reported only once, at the end of the input file
(unless USR1 signals are caught by use of the
.Fl s
flag).
.It Fl -evaluate Ar tclcommands
.Ar Tclcommands
is a list of Tcl commands to be executed while starting
.Nm flstats .
.It Fl -flowtypes Ar flowspecifier[s]
A list of one or more flow specifiers.  While the format of a flow
specifier can, in general, be fairly complicated (see the
.Nm flstats
user's manual which, sadly, does not exist), for the purpose of this
man page a flow specifier is a list of one or more IP header field
names (plus the port fields from TCP and/or UDP headers) separated by
slashes ("/").  The header fields supported are named: ihv, ihl, tos,
len, id, df, mf, foff, ttl, prot, sum, src, dst, sport, dport.
.It Fl -oexcl Ar {class|flow|ri} fieldnames
This allows the deletion of fields from the summary statistics reported
at the end of each reporting interval.  This is not as general a
mechanism as is
.Fl -ospec .
.Ar class ,
.Ar flow ,
and
.Ar ri
specify which of the sets of statistics the
.Ar fieldnames
parameters apply.
.Ar Ri
applies to those statistics related to the specific reporting
interval.  This option can be repeated multiple times (for each of
.Ar class ,
.Ar flow ,
and
.Ar ri ,
say).
.It Fl -ospec Ar {class|flow|ri}
This allows finer control of what is printed out than does the
.Fl -oexcl
option.  For a given set of statistics (specified, as in the
.Fl -oexcl
option, by
.Ar class ,
.Ar flow ,
and
.Ar ri )
the
.Ar outputspecifier
is a set of triples separated by colon (":"):
:Ar [fieldname][:[label][:int]
where
.Ar fieldname
is an output fieldname from the selected group of statistics;
.Ar label
is the label to be printed instead of
.Ar fieldname
(if missing, the default is
.Ar fieldname );
and
.Ar int
is the literal string "int".  The action of the
.Fl -ospec
is to cause only the listed fields of the specific group of statistics
(again, specified by the
.Ar class ,
.Ar flow ,
and
.Ar ri
parameter) to be printed.  Each such field is printed; if
.Ar int
for a field, it means the field (presumably a floating point number)
should be rounded (to the nearest integer) before being printed.

A special case is when no
.Ar fieldname
is specified (so, the spec looks like
.Ar :label[:int] ),
in which case the literal string of the
.Ar label
parameter is printed out at that point on the output line.  In this
special case, if
.Ar :int
is printed in this case, no separator is printed between this label
and the next printed field.

(Note that whereas
.Fl -oexcl
does *not* change the *order* of fields printed, only excludes some of
those fields, the
.Fl -ospec
parameter *does* change to order of fields printed to the order in
.Ar outputspecifier .)
.It Fl -scriptfile Ar filename
The name of a file to be passed to
.Nm flstats'
internal Tcl interpreter during startup.
.It Fl -sep Ar separator
Specify the
.Ar separator
used to separate values in the summary statistics.  The
.Ar separator
is *not* printed before the first, or after that last, statistic on
the line.
.It Fl -timebase Ar {T|t}{T|t|r}
The default (which can be specified by specifying
.Ar TT )
is to print all times in the summary statistics as
secs.usecs from the Unix epoch (01.01.1970).  The
.Fl -timebase
option allows re-basing the printed times.  The time of the beginning
of reporting intervals, as well as the time the last packet in a given
class was received, can be printed relative to the beginning of the
trace by specifying a
.Ar t
as the first character of this option.

The rest of the times printed in the trace can also be specified to be
relative to the start of the trace by specifying
.Ar t
as the second character of this option.  Alternatively, the rest of
the times can be printed relative to the start of the
currently-being-reported reporting interval by specfying
.Ar r
as the second character of this option.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To see how many source/destination pairs there were in a trace, along
with the number of packets, bytes, and other information about the data
flowing between them:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% flstats -T -c --flowtypes src/dst --timebase tr file.tcpd
binno 0 ri_start 0.000000 ri_end 15.762258 ri_firstpkt 0.002680 ri_lastpkt 15.559384 ri_pkts 507 ri_bytes 355444 ri_tsipg 0.105973 ri_isipg 0.105973 ignorepkts 24 ignorebytes 1132 unclpkts 0 unclbytes 0 type src/dst created 18 deleted 0 added 0 removed 0 active 18 pkts 507 bytes 355444 sipg 0.105973 lastrecv 15.559384
.Ed
.Pp
The above says that in bin number 0 (the only bin)
there were 18 unique source/destination pairs
which together exchanged 507 packets totalling 355,444 bytes.
The smoothed interpacket arrival time was 105,973 microseconds.

To actually list out the source/destination pairs in the trace:

Here, we've specified
.Ar I
in order to make the output a bit easier for we humans to understand.
The above output tells us that source 192.168.2.184 sent 143 packets,
totalling 13047 bytes, to destination 208.80.154.240, as well as
information about 17 other sources (including information about source
208.80.154.240 sending to destination 192.168.2.184).

To see how many different TOS values there are in the trace:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% flstats -HI -c --flowtypes tos --timebase tr file.tcpd
binno ri_start ri_end ri_firstpkt ri_lastpkt ri_pkts ri_bytes ri_tsipg ri_isipg ignorepkts ignorebytes unclpkts unclbytes

Here, we've changed the
.Fl T
to
.Fl H
to print out the column labels once, at the beginning of the trace.
This is a bit harder to read, but more compact.  The above output
tells us same tos field was set in all the processed packet.  To see
which value this was:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% flstats -HI -f --flowtypes tos --ospec flow id --timebase tr file.tcpd
binno ri_start ri_end ri_firstpkt ri_lastpkt ri_pkts ri_bytes ri_tsipg ri_isipg ignorepkts ignorebytes unclpkts unclbytes
    id

    0
.Ed
.Pp
Here we've used the
.Fl -ospec
option to change the reporting for
.Ar flow
statistics to *only* print out the
.Ar id
field.  We see that the tos value used in all the packets in this
trace was the value 0.
.Pp
What about packet size distribution in the trace file?  First, to see
how many different packet sizes are in the file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% flstats --c --t len file.tcpd
bin 0 class 0 created 415 deleted 0 added 0 removed 0 active 415
pkts 32546 bytes 11296427 sipg 0.018453 fragpkts 0 fragbytes 0
toosmallpkts 0 toosmallbytes 0 runtpkts 0 runtbytes 0
noportpkts 0 noportbytes 0 lastrecv 821828470.105442
.Ed
.Pp
So, there are 415 distinct lengths in the file.  To see the actual
lengths:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% flstats --f --t len file.tcpd | sort -n -r +9

This also shows the interpacket arrival time (smoothed) between
packets of the same time.  To see only the lengths, packet counts
and byte counts, we could pipe the above through
.Bd -literal -offset indent
awk '{print $10, $12, $14}'
